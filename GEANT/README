                            Example01
                            ---------

	This example simulates a Hadron Endcap (HE) calorimeter
        with SE (photon preshower) and ECAL in front of
        and some additional dead materials between ECAL and HE. 
	(This setup is very close to the real geometry)
	
 1- GEOMETRY DEFINITION
 -----------------------

 	The HE calorimeter is a box (149.6) along X-axis made 
        of 17 layers. The front of HE calorimeter starts from
        x=0.0*cm and propagates to positive direction. The transverse
        calorimeter dimension is 100.0*cm X 100.0*cm (Y and Z axis). 
        Each layer (8.8*cm) consists of an absorber plate (79.0*mm Brass) 
        and of an air gap (9.0*mm). Inside air gap the aluminium wrapper 
        (7.0*mm) is placed. The sensitive plate of 3.9*mm thickness of 
        scintillator is inside of aluminium wrapper. The layer is
 	replicated.
 	
        In front of HE calorimeter the next materials are placed:

          a) Zero layer of HE calorimeter (15.0*mm aluminium wrapper
             and 9.0*mm sensitive scintillator material);

          b) Cables from ECAL (1.5*mm of copper at x = -35.8*cm);

          c) G10 plate behind ECAL and in front of HE (2.5*mm at x = -59.80*cm);

          d) ECAL itself (22.0*cm box of PWO4 material at x = -70.80*cm);

          e) Aluminium support in front of ECAL (4.5*mm at x = -82.025*cm);

          f) Aluminium part of SE (photon preshower) (3.0*cm at x = -98.3*cm);

          g) Lead part of SE (photon preshower) (1.5*cm at x = 100.55*cm);

          h) G10 plate in front of SE (2.5*mm at x = -101.425*cm). 	

 2- HISTOGRAMs
 --------------
   
        There are 3 TH1D-histos with deposited energies in the different
        part of setup: 

          a) Ecal - total deposited energy in ECAL (GeV scale);

          b) Hcal - sum of deposited energy in all sensitive
                    (scintillator) layers (MeV scale);

          c) Zero - deposited energy in the scintillator of "zero"
                    HE layer.

         First ROOT 'TTree' "Total" presents the same deposited energies 
         in the ROOT tree format.     

         Second ROOT 'TTree' "Vector" presents deposited energies for 
         each layer (17 entries) of HE calorimeter.
