	- Modified scintillation readout to keep energy deposit in fibre rather
	  than propose scintillation photons.  
	- Introduced more optimimal geometry hierarchy to improve runtime.
	- New geometry hierarchy does not allow direct setting of detector width.
	  The new scheme requires number of fibres in a segment and number of segments
	  to define the width.
	- The new geometry improves run time by factor of 4 on top of factor of 2 to from
	  scintillation readout.

	- Added command to HepMCG4AsciiReader to skip to first event to read
	- Added some elements to the CMSHFDetectorConstruction (H and C) for 
	  future use in plastic scintillator
	- Added proper definition of plastic scintillator (in comments for now)
	  material to CMSHFDetectorConstruction.

	- Added random seed to log output.  There was a problem in reading from 
 	  /dev/urandom causing odd things with the random seed.  It should be
	  fixed now.
	- Switched off photon track propagation in HFStackingAction.cc
05/20/2013  Christopher Cowden Christopher.Cowden@cern.ch
	- Added an alternative geometry CMSHFDetectorConstruction and corresponding
	  messenger class to simulate blocks of a CMS calorimeter based on solid W
	  rather than rods.  There is a new executable compiled from detectorVolume.cc
	  and some new macros (detVol.mac and detVis.mac).  This new executable  can
	  be compile by `make name=detectorVolume`.  
	- detectorVolume.cc just like testBeam.cc but it uses the CMSHFDetectorConstruction
 	  classes to build the geometry.
	- CMSHFDetectorConstruction creates a solid W block with fibers 1.2 mm apart in a 
	  grid.  Half of the fibers are quartz and half are scintillating (scsf-78) fibers.
	- Modified HFDataFormat to separately readout Cherenkov fibers and scintillating
	  fibers.  New branches were added for the scintillating fibers such that analysis
	  code for quartz only model do not need to change.
	- Modified HFStackingAction to readout Cherenkov and Scintillation.
 	- Modified HFSteppingAction to readout Cherenkov and Scintillation fibers.

	- Added a cladding to quartz fibers
 	- Added "PMT" readout to ntuple (optical photon information at end of fiber)
	- Included a glass plate at back of calorimeter to capture optical photons
	- Made geometry overlap check a boolean flag in HFDetectorConstruction
	- Set calorimeter half length to 0.5 m
	- added HFSteppingAction to readout photons at end of fibers
	  This class also limits the global time of photons to 100 ns

            - using "FTFP_BERT" physics list as default in replacement of "LHEP" 
              since the later is declared to be no longer supported in recent/future 
              Geant4 version. 
            - modified class HepMCG4AsciiReader to be independent of 
              class HepMCG4Interface
            - removed redundant classes: HepMCG4Interface, HFPhysicsList, and 
              HFPhysicsListMessenger 
            - change class name HFMessenger to be HFDetectorConstructionMessenger 
              since it only serves for class HFDetectorConstruction.
            - ParticleGun: 
               - added back the method to store the particle gun positions that 
                  was not reimplemented in the last update.
               - users can choose for particle gun position smearing methods: flat or gaussian.
            - DataFormat:
               - added methods to select the information to store in the output root file.
               - fixed crashes in certain circumstances when storing only part of the information.

            - Moved the 1 meter long stack of the tungsten to 7.2 meters 
              positive Z axis, i.e. starting at 6.7 meters.
            - Increased the volume to cover |eta|>3.0, i.e. 268 rods in X.
            - Changed all those variables that associated with an unit to 
              G4 variable, e.g. those "double" to "G4double".
            - Changed some "inline" functions to be not "inline", they are 
              just not needed to be called outside their class.
            - The file "HFPrimaryGeneratorMessneger.cc" is a typo, replaced 
              with the right one "HFPrimaryGeneratorMessenger.cc" 
            - Removed the hard coded flat smearing while introduced a more 
              completed class "ParticleGunGenerator" to do all kinds of 
              smearings. E.g. position smearing, direction angular smearing,
              momentum smearing, and two smearing options "uniform" and  
              "gaussian".
            - Copied over the HepMC interface from the Shashlik project for 
              reading in event generator files that are stored in HepMC format. 
              This requires additional installation of the HepMC package. 
              For the installation, please refer to:
               http://lcgapp.cern.ch/project/simu/HepMC/
            - Prepared a CMakeLists.txt that can be installed using cmake.
              An installation recipy using CMake is documented in INSTALL.cmake
