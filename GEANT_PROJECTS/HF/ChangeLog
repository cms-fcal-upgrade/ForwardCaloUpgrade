            - Moved the 1 meter long stack of the tungsten to 7.2 meters 
              positive Z axis, i.e. starting at 6.7 meters.
            - Increased the volume to cover |eta|>3.0, i.e. 268 rods in X.
            - Changed all those variables that associated with an unit to 
              G4 variable, e.g. those "double" to "G4double".
            - Changed some "inline" functions to be not "inline", they are 
              just not needed to be called outside their class.
            - The file "HFPrimaryGeneratorMessneger.cc" is a typo, replaced 
              with the right one "HFPrimaryGeneratorMessenger.cc" 
            - Removed the hard coded flat smearing while introduced a more 
              completed class "ParticleGunGenerator" to do all kinds of 
              smearings. E.g. position smearing, direction angular smearing,
              momentum smearing, and two smearing options "uniform" and  
              "gaussian".
            - Copied over the HepMC interface from the Shashlik project for 
              reading in event generator files that are stored in HepMC format. 
              This requires additional installation of the HepMC package. 
              For the installation, please refer to:
               http://lcgapp.cern.ch/project/simu/HepMC/
            - Prepared a CMakeLists.txt that can be installed using cmake.
              An installation recipy using CMake is documented in INSTALL.cmake
