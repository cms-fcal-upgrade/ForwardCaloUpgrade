                            ---------

	This example simulates a Hadron Endcap (HE) calorimeter
        with SE (photon preshower) and ECAL in front of
        and some additional dead materials between ECAL and HE. 
	(This setup is very close to the real geometry)
	
 1- GEOMETRY DEFINITION
 -----------------------

 	The HE calorimeter is a box (149.6) along X-axis made 
        of 17 layers. The front of HE calorimeter starts from
        x=0.0*cm and propagates to positive direction. The transverse
        calorimeter dimension is 100.0*cm X 100.0*cm (Y and Z axis). 
        Each layer (8.8*cm) consists of an absorber plate (79.0*mm Brass) 
        and of an air gap (9.0*mm). Inside air gap the aluminium wrapper 
        (7.0*mm) is placed. The sensitive plate of 3.9*mm thickness of 
        scintillator is inside of aluminium wrapper. The layer is
 	replicated.
 	
        In front of HE calorimeter the next materials are placed:

          a) Zero layer of HE calorimeter (15.0*mm aluminium wrapper
             and 9.0*mm sensitive scintillator material);

          b) Cables from ECAL (1.5*mm of copper at x = -35.8*cm);

          c) G10 plate behind ECAL and in front of HE (2.5*mm at x = -59.80*cm);

          d) ECAL itself (22.0*cm box of PbWO4 material at x = -70.80*cm);

          e) Aluminium support in front of ECAL (4.5*mm at x = -82.025*cm);

          f) Aluminium part of SE (photon preshower) (3.0*cm at x = -98.3*cm);

          g) Lead part of SE (photon preshower) (1.5*cm at x = 100.55*cm);

          h) G10 plate in front of SE (2.5*mm at x = -101.425*cm). 	

    1a. The new option is introduced for the ECAL geometry:
    -------------------------------------------------------

          a) as default geometry - ECAL consist of 22.0*cm box of PbWO4 material;
          
          b) second option - ECAL is a sampling calorimeter with the set of variable
             parameters: number of calorimetr's layers, thickness of absorber and  
             sensitive layers, different absorber and sensitive materials. All 
             these parameters can be chosen by user in hadr01.in file; 

          c) also there possibility to apply uniform magnetic field along z-axis; 
 
          d) example how to set these parameters is presented below:

# Set Ecal geometry (sampling calorimeter - "Shashlyk")
#------------------------------------------------------
# total length of Ecal calorimeter L=(AbsThick+SensThick)*NbOfLayers
# must be  <= 22.0 cm
#
# Absorber materials are: Lead, Brass, Tungsten.
# 
# Sensitive materials are: LAG, YAG, LSO, LYSO PbWO, where:
#----------------------------------------------------------
# Sens1 = (LAG  = Lu3_Al5_O12  and density 6.70 g/cm3); 
# Sens2 = (YAG  = Y3_Al5_O12   and density 5.47 g/cm3);  
# Sens3 = (LSO  = Lu2_Si_O5    and density 7.34 g/cm3);
# Sens4 = (LYSO = Lu2_Y2_Si_O5 and density 7.30 g/cm3);
# PbWO  = (PbWO = Pb_W_O4      and density 8.30 g/cm3);
#----------------------------------------------------------
#
# There is possibility to apply uniform magnetic field
# along z-axis (1 Tesla = 10 kG)

 2- HISTOGRAMs
 --------------
   
      There are 3 TH1D-histos with deposited energies in the different
      part of setup: 

          a) Ecal - total deposited energy in sensitive ECAL (GeV scale);

          b) Hcal - sum of deposited energy in all sensitive
                    (scintillator) layers (MeV scale);

          c) Zero - deposited energy in the scintillator of "zero"
                    HE layer.

      There are also ROOT "TTree" with different values:

          a) ROOT 'TTree' "Total" presents deposited energy in sensitive
             layers of ECAL, HCAL, Zero-layer and total range of charged 
             particles in sensitive layers of HCAL.

          b) ROOT 'TTree' "Vector" presents deposited energies for each
             layer (17 entries) of HE calorimeter. 
            
          c) ROOT 'TTree' "Range" presents range of charged particles for 
             each layer (17 entries) of HE calorimeter.
          
          d) ROOT 'TTree' "Cell" presents deposited energies for each
             cell (1700 entries) of HE calorimeter. Cell contains deposited
             energy for each HE layers as function of radius (100 bins with 
             step 1.0*cm). Cell number is determined as:

             i_cell =  int( sqrt(yhit*yhit+zhit*zhit) / 10. ) + 100*n_layer;
