                            ---------

	This example simulates a Hadron Endcap (HE) calorimeter
        with SE (photon preshower) and ECAL in front of
        and some additional dead materials between ECAL and HE. 
	(This setup is very close to the real geometry)
	
 1- GEOMETRY DEFINITION
 -----------------------

 	The Hadron Endcap (HE) calorimeter is a box (149.6) along Z-axis 
        consisting of 17 layers. The front of HE calorimeter starts from
        z=397.2*cm and propagates to positive direction. The transverse
        HE calorimeter size is 540.0*cm (X-axis) and 540.0*cm (Y-axis). 
        Each HE layer (88.0*mm) consists of an absorber plate (79.0*mm Brass) 
        and of an air gap (9.0*mm). Inside air gap the aluminum wrapper 
        (8.0*mm) is placed. The sensitive plate of 3.7*mm thickness of 
        scintillator is inside of aluminum wrapper. The layer is replicated.
 	
        In front of HE calorimeter the next materials are placed:

          a) Zero layer of HE calorimeter (15.0*mm aluminum wrapper
             with 9.0*mm sensitive scintillator material inside);

          b) Dead material (cables from ECAL) (23.4*cm of copper at z = 366.675*cm);
		      (since V00_03_00 this position is relative to ECAL size,
              this was done to center dead material between ECAL and HCAL); 

          c) G10 plate behind ECAL and in front of HE (2.5*mm at z = 337.525*cm);
             (since V00_03_00 this position is relative to ECAL size,
              this was done to have possibility to increase Ecal size
			  and dead material size); 

          d) ECAL itself (220.0*mm box of PbWO4 material at z = 326.4*cm);

          e) Aluminum support in front of ECAL (4.5*mm at z = 312.2*cm);

          f) Aluminum part of SE (photon preshower) (2.72*cm at z = 298.9*cm);

          g) Lead part of SE (photon preshower) (1.3*cm at z = 296.65*cm);

          h) G10 plate in front of SE (2.5*mm at z = 295.775*cm). 	

    1a. The new option is introduced for the ECAL geometry:
    -------------------------------------------------------

          a) as default geometry - ECAL is 220.0*mm box of PbWO4 material;
          
          b) second option - ECAL is a sampling calorimeter with the set of 
             variable parameters: number of calorimeter's layers, thickness of 
             absorber and  sensitive layers, different absorber and sensitive 
             materials. All these parameters can be chosen by user through 
             input file (hadr01.in); 

          c) also there is possibility to apply uniform magnetic field along 
             z-axis; 
 
          d) user can chose the value of production cuts for the different
             sensitive and absorber medias (Ecal and Hcal);

          e) since V00_02_00 release total size of ECAL can be extended 
             till 400.0*mm along z-axis;
		  
		  f) since V00_03_00 total size of dead material can be extended
		     to 400.0*mm along z-axis;
 
          g) examples of how to set these parameters are presented in: ele01.in, hadr01.in

		  h) Notes on Birks' law parametrization:
		  
		     Chou-Birks law:
             double rkb     = birk1/density;
             double c       = birk2*rkb*rkb;
             if (abs(charge) >= 2.) rkb /= birk3; // based on alpha particle data
             weight = 1./(1.+rkb*dedx+c*dedx*dedx);
			 
			 L3 Birks law:
             weight = 1. - birkSlope*log(rkb*dedx);
             if (weight < birkCut) weight = birkCut;
             else if (weight > 1.) weight = 1.;


 2- HISTOGRAMs
 --------------

      There are 3 TH1D-histograms with deposited energies in the different
      part of setup: 

          a) Ecal - total deposited energy in sensitive ECAL (GeV scale);

          b) Hcal - sum of deposited energy in all sensitive
                    (scintillator) layers (MeV scale);

          c) Zero - deposited energy in the scintillator of "zero"
                    HE layer.

      There are also ROOT "TTree" with different values:

          a) ROOT 'TTree' "Total" presents deposited energy in sensitive
             layers of ECAL, HCAL, Zero-layer and in Ecal absorber material;

          b) ROOT 'TTree' "Vector" presents deposited energies for each
             layer (17 entries) of HE calorimeter; 

          c) ROOT 'TTree' "Range" presents total range of charged in
             sensitive medias of Ecal and HCAL.
            
          d) ROOT 'TTree' "Cell" presents deposited energy in cells
             of Ecal calorimeter. 
 
      The 6 TH1D-histograms with shower profile distributions are presents:
             
          a) EcalTrShape - Ecal transverse shower profile;

          b) EcalLoShape - Ecal longitudinal shower profile; 

          c) HcalTrShape - Hcal transverse shower profile;

          d) HcalLoShape - Hcal longitudinal shower profile;

          e) AbsTrShape  - absorber Ecal transverse shower profile;
       
          f) AbsLoShape  - absorber Ecal longitudinal shower profile;

       The 2 TH1D-histograms with Moliere radius (cylinder with 90% of energy)
       are added:
      
          a) EcalSensMol - distribution for Ecal sensitive material;
                    
          b) EcalAbsMol  - distribution for Ecal absorber material;

       There is the possibility to change the bin width and total number 
       of bins for these (shower profiles) histograms. See examples: ele01.in, hadr01.in

 3- CHANGE PHYSICS LIST
 ----------------------

  a) open with editor the fcalor.cc-file in the main directory;

  b) chose the next 2-lines with preferable physics list,
     for example:

     #include QGSP_BERT_EMV.hh 
     and
     runManager-> SetUserInitialization(new QGSP_BERT_EMV)
  
 4- Optional HepMC ASCII File Usage
 ----------------------------------
 
   Since V00_03_00 release, there is an option to use particles from an event 
   generator like Pythia. Any events in the standardized HepMC format can be 
   input through an ASCII text file. The folder UserCode/ForwardCaloUpgrade/Pythia 
   shows an example of how to generate such a file. The sample input file 
   hepmc01.in shows how to select the hepmcAscii primary generator and use the 
   ascii file.
     	
 5- HOW TO START 
 ----------------

   Now all necessary environment settings are collected in
   config.csh - file. User can change this setting for his choice.

  a) source config.csh

  c) gmake 

  e) Run program 

     $MyGeant/fcalor hadr01.in > test_out01
