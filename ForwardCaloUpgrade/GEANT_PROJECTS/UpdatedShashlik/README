Before getting started, you must have a copy of HepMC, Xerces, clhep,
and geant4. Within SarahEno/HlLHC you must edit the setup.sh and 
setup_geant_temp.sh (or .csh) files to contain the correct paths to your 
local copies of geant, HepMC, clhep, and Xerces. Then you must source 
these files.

To aid in compatibilities issues, the versions of the software used
in developing this version of the stand-alone code are:

Geant4 - geant4.9.4.p04
clhep - x86_64-slc5-gcc43-opt
Xerces - xerces-c-3.1.1-x86_64-linux-gcc-3.4
HepMC - 2.06.08
