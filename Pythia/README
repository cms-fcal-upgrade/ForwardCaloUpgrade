 This is the short instruction how to generate Jets using
 Pythia8 program. Jets are produced from q qbar or g g systems
 which are hadronized. Output events are written in HepMC 
 ASCII text format.

 Files config.csh, config.mk and Makefile contain all
 necessary information for setting environment for this job. 
 User can change this setting for his choice.   

 For running job you need to perform the next steps:

 1. source config.csh - set environment;

 2. make JetsGen - produce executable;

 3. change input values in JetsGen.in - file;

 4. run job

  ./JetsGen.exe JetsGen.in HepMCoutJets.dat > test_out01
